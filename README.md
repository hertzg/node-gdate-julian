# GDate (GLib) style julian days to and from gregorian date converter
Port of GLib functions to work with julian days, to convert between it and gregorian date.
Library was initially developed to help a sister library [node-xhb](https://github.com/hertzg/node-xhb) work with 
file generated by [HomeBank](http://homebank.free.fr/en/)

## Install
```javascript 1.8
npm install gdate-julian
```

## Usage
Import ESM style
```ecmascript 6
import {g_date_to_julian_days, g_julian_days_to_date} from 'gdate-julian' 
```
or CJS Style
```javascript 1.8
const {g_date_to_julian_days, g_julian_days_to_date} = require('gdate-julian')
```

each method is also exported as `camelCase` alias:

```ecmascript 6
import {gDate2JulianDays, gJulianDays2Date} from 'gdate-julian' 
```
or CJS Style
```javascript 1.8
const {gDate2JulianDays, gJulianDays2Date} = require('gdate-julian')
```

## Example
Here we show small example how to convert between Gregorian Date and Julian Days
More detailed examples can be found in tests in `./src/__tests__/g_date_conversion_spec.js`

### Gregorian Date to Julian Days
```ecmascript 6
const julianDays = gDate2JulianDays(new Date('1900-01-01T12:00:00Z'))
console.log(julianDays) // outputs 693596
```

### Julian Days to Gregorian Date 
```ecmascript 6
const gregorianDate = gJulianDays2Date(693596)
console.log(gregorianDate) // outputs 1900-01-01T12:00:00Z
```

## TypeScript definitions
Project also includes type definitions for TypeScript in `./src/index.d.ts`
```typescript
export type g_date_is_leap_year = (year: number) => boolean;
export type g_julian_days_to_date = (julian_days: number) => Date;
export type g_date_to_julian_days = (date: Date) => number;
```
